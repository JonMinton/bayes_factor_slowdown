# Mortality Projections and Probability of Slowdown

This repository contains analysis of publically available mortality data on two linked research areas

* Projections of mortality in UK nations (and UK as a whole) up to and beyond 2012 based on trends in $e_0$ up to 2011
* Estimates of the likelihood there's been a slowdown in life expectancy from 2012 onwards given recent observations and past trends, and the relatively likelihood of different proposed magnitudes of decline
